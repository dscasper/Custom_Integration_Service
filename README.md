# Salesforce Custom Integration Service

The purpose of this project is to create a single rest endpoint in salesforce and be able to dynamically inject routes. This is to serve as a POC for unlocked package dependencies and creating a building block. Security would be maintained through  multiple permission sets. One in the base package to provide security to the endpoint then in implementation packages with class, object and field permissions.

# Warning:
This is a project that has been in my head for a couple of years now. This is based mainly on theory and has not been implemented in a production environment and is a work in progress. Feel free to leave comments or questions. This is just a way for me to implement things that I'm learning and share with others.
